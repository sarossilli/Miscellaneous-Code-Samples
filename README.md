# Miscellaneous Code Samples
A Repo of miscellaneous code written for courses. Each folder is for a different course.

### Courses:
- Algorithms: CS 4720 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
    - Design methodologies; divide-and-conquer, exhaustive search, dynamic programming. Time and space complexity measures, analysis of algorithms. Survey of important algorithms for searching, sorting, graph manipulation. Tractability: class P and NP, NP complete problems. 
- C++ : CS 3060 - Object-Oriented Programming Using C++
    - The principal goals of this course are: 1) to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, 2) to gain skill and proficiency in using the C++ programming language, 3) to exercise the C++ language in implementing a moderate sized software system designed with objects.
- Java: CS 1450 - Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Concepts of data type, data abstraction, and data structure. Internal representations of fundamental data types. Linear data structures: stack, queue. Linked data structures and dynamic data types. Search table data abstraction, linear search in arrays and lists, binary search in arrays and trees. Binary trees, non-binary trees, binary search trees.
- Linear Algebra: CS 2300 - Computational Linear Algebra
    - Covers mathematical as well as computational aspects of Linear Algebra. The class will apply/explore these concepts: Vectors, Matrices, 2D, 3D, and ND Transforms and Graphics, Systems of Linear Equations, Eigenvalues/ Eigenvectors, Numerical Stability, and Linear Filters/Predictors.
